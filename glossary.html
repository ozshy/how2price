<h3><a name="advertising">Advertising</a></h3>
<p>A costly marketing tool by which firms obtain get new customers or old
customers to repurchase the advertised brand(s). The economist literature
classifies advertising into two categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">Persuasive-advertising</font> which boosts the demand
for the brand(s) by simply "persuading" more consumers to buy the
product and/or persuading consumers to buy more units. Persuasive advertising
sometimes relies on creating an image for potential consumers to identify with.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">Informative-advertising</font> that may provide
information about products' characteristics, usefulness, operation, warranty, as
well as specific prices. One commonly-used type of informative-advertising is
called <font color="#ff0000">comparison-advertising</font> by which the
advertised brand is directly compared with specific characteristics of a
particular competing brand.&nbsp; Comparison advertising in particular, and
information advertising in general, tend to make brands more 
<A href="#differentiated"><strong>differentiated</strong></A>, 
thereby weakening price competition among sellers in the industry.</p>

<h3><a name="bundling">Bundling</a></h3>
<p> Bundling, also known as quantity-discount, refers to the sale of a package
containing several (more than one) units of the same product. This bundle is
priced as a package and not per-unit. Bundling involves selling of several units
of the same good for a single price; in this respect it differs from 
<A href="#tying"><strong>tying</strong></A> which
involves packaging units of different goods. </p>
<h5><A href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</A></h5>
<hr>

<h3><a name="capacity">Capacity constraint</a></h3>
<p>By <font color="#ff0000">capacity constraint</font> we refer to a situation
where a firm cannot produce beyond a certain output level.&nbsp; We generally
denote by <i>Q</i>max the maximum number of units the firm can produce.&nbsp;
Capacity constraint models are also useful to describe firms or stores that are
"stuck" with inventories with a low marginal delivery cost.</p>
<p>When a firm's profit maximizing output level exceeds the capacity level we
say that the capacity constraint is <font color="#ff0000">binding</font>.&nbsp;
When a firm's profit-maximizing levels is below the capacity level, we say that
the capacity constraint is <font color="#ff0000">non-binding</font> (meaning
that the firm can ignore its capacity constraint when solving for its
profit-maximizing output or price levels.</p>
<p>In services sectors (as well as in some other highly-perishable goods 
sectors), capacity constraint leads to <a href="#refund">overbooking</a> of 
customers when consumers have positive probability of no-shows. This is because 
of the high opportunity cost of underutilized capacity.</p>

<h3><a name="concentration">Concentration measures</a></h3>
<p>A concentration index is a number reflecting the degree of monopoly power
captured by imperfectly-competitive firms (sellers).&nbsp; The highest degree of
concentration is associated with a single seller (monopoly) holding 100% of the
market.&nbsp; The degree of concentration declines with an increase in the
number of active firms (sellers), and/or a change towards more equally-divided
market shares. </p>
<p>The most-commonly used concentration indexes are:&nbsp; The <font color="#FF0000">4-largest-firms
concentration index</font> (0 &lt; <i>I</i><sub>4</sub> &lt; 100%) which sums
the market shares&nbsp; (in %) of the 4 largest firms.&nbsp; The <font color="#FF0000">Herfindahl-Hirshman
index</font> (0 &lt; <i>I</i><sub>HH</sub> &lt; 10,000 = 100<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;
which sums the squares of the market shares (in %) of active firms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Concentration indexes are used by the regulating authorities to
evaluate the market consequences of a (<font color="#0000FF">horizontal</font>) <a href="#merger">merger</a>
of two firms in the same industry.&nbsp; </p>
<h5><A href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</A></h5>

<h3><a name="cost">Cost of production</a></h3>
<p>Let <EM>q</EM> denote the production 
(output level) of a single 
firm.&nbsp; That is, <EM>q</EM> denotes the number of units produced.&nbsp; 
Economic theory classifies cost of production into four components:</p>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Marginal cost of production, denoted by <EM>MC</EM>(<EM>q</EM>).&nbsp; 
  The marginal cost is the change in production cost associated with a small 
  increase in the production level (small could be one unit).</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Average cost of production, denoted by <EM>AC</EM>(<EM>q</EM>).&nbsp; The 
  average cost is the cost-per-unit of production, obtained by dividing total 
  cost by the output level.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Fixed cost of production, denoted by <EM>F</EM>.&nbsp; The fixed cost is 
  the sum of all costs that are independent of the production level (i.e., costs 
  that must be borne even if no output is produced).</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Sunk cost.&nbsp; Same as fixed cost, but this cost cannot be recouped in 
  case that the firm ceases to exist.&nbsp; For example, cost of advertising and 
  taxes paid.</DIV></LI></OL>

<h3><a name="mass">Critical mass</a></h3>
<p>Consider a service by which each consumer benefits from an increase in the
total number of consumers subscribed to the same service. At a given
subscription price, <i>p</i>, the <font color="#ff0000">critical mass at <i>p</i></font>
is the minimum number of subscribed consumers that will guarantee that more
consumers will subscribed to the same service in the future.</p>
<p>Example include telecommunication services where no consumer will ever
subscribe knowing that no one else subscribes.&nbsp; For example, no consumer
will subscribe to a phone or an Internet network knowing that no one else will
since no communication can be made.&nbsp; However, at any given subscription
price, there is a threshold subscription volume beyond which more consumers will
subscribe simply because they can interact with a "sufficient" number
of other subscribed consumers.</p>
<p>Critical mass has also social implication. When organizing&nbsp; party, one
has to secure a minimum number of people who are willing to commit to
participate. Once this critical mass is secure, it is clear that everybody else
will also show up for the party.</p>

<h3><a name="demand">Demand function</a></h3>
<p>A demand function summarizes and observed relationship 
between quantity demanded by consumers and given market prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, 
the demand function&nbsp;captures the&nbsp;maximum amount consumers are willing 
to pay at any given&nbsp;price.&nbsp; Let <EM>p</EM> denote a given market price 
and <EM>Q</EM> aggregate quantity demanded in a given market, this relationship 
is summarized by a function <EM>Q</EM>(<EM>p</EM>          
          ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>For historical reasons, economists tend to write the 
<FONT color=red>inverse demand function</FONT> rather than the direct demand 
function in the form of&nbsp;<EM>p</EM>(<EM>Q</EM>  ).&nbsp; Thus, the inverse demand function captures the maximum
price consumers are willing to pay to by any given quantity.</p>
<p>An inverse demand function is said to be <FONT 
color=red>linear</FONT> if it takes the form <EM>p</EM> = <EM>a</EM> - <EM>b 
Q</EM>, where <EM>a</EM> &gt; 0 and <EM>b</EM> &gt; 0.&nbsp; For example, 
<EM>p</EM> = 12 - 3 <EM>Q</EM>, in which case the direct demand function would 
be&nbsp; <EM>Q</EM> = 
  4 - <EM>p</EM> / 3.</p>
<p>A demand function is called <font color="#ff0000"> exponential</font> or a <font color="#ff0000">constant</font>-<A href="#elasticity"><FONT color=blue>elasticity</FONT></A> demand function 
if it takes the form of&nbsp; <EM>Q</EM> = <I>a</I> 
<EM>p<SUP>-e</SUP></EM>,&nbsp;where <EM>a</EM> &gt; 0.&nbsp; The estimated
parameter&nbsp;<EM>e</EM>&nbsp;&lt; 0 is the demand <A href="#elasticity"><FONT 
color=blue>elasticity</FONT></A> which happens to be constant (i.e., does not vary when prices and quantities) 
for  this demand function.</p>
<p>
Whereas ordinary demand functions are downward sloping (in the price-quantity
space), meaning that a fall in price tends to increase quantity demanded, the demand for <A href="#network"><strong>network</strong></A> services and
products has a unique feature where the <font color="#0000ff"> inverse</font> demand increases
(rather than decreases) at low
aggregate consumption levels reflecting the fact that consumers are willing to
pay a higher (subscription) prices for more popular services .</p>
<p>Demand functions are estimated using <A href="#regression"><strong>regression</strong></A>
equations that catalog observed prices, quantity demanded, and perhaps other
variables, such as advertising and income levels, for the purpose of extracting
the parameters charactering the demand relationship (for example, intercepts and
slopes).</p>

<h3><a name="differentiated">Differentiated products</a></h3>
<p>A strict definition of differentiated products (differentiated brands) refers
to brands that consumers distinguish among the different producers of the different brands. In fact,
the brands may or may not be physically different, but even if they are not
physically different, competition among sellers of otherwise
identical products would lead firms to engage in heavy advertising that turns <A href="#homogeneous"><strong>homogeneous products</strong></A>
 into differentiated brands.</p>
<p>Markets for differentiated brands are generally characterize by heavy
<A href="#advertising"><strong>advertising</strong></A> attempting to associate an image with the advertised brand, consumer
<A href="#switch"><strong>switching costs</strong></A>, and reputation effects.&nbsp; All these factors weaken price
competition which enable competing firms to exert some degree of monopoly power
over their customers.</p>
<h5><A href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</A></h5>

<hr>
<h3><a name="elasticity">Elasticity of demand</a></h3>
<p>            The <font color="#ff0000">price elasticity</font> at a given
price-quantity pair (<i>p</i>,<i>Q</i>) , is defined by the ratio: Percentage
change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in
price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>            At a given price, the price elasticity, denoted by <i>e</i>, is a
number between zero and minus infinity.&nbsp; For example, if <i>e</i> = -2, a
10% increase in price will reduce quantity demanded by 20%.&nbsp; If <i>e</i> = 
-1,&nbsp; we say that the demand elasticity is unity, in which case a 10%
increase in price will result in a 10% fall in quantity demanded.</p>
<p>On a given demand function, elasticity varies with the price (quantity), so
elasticity is a function and not a number.&nbsp; However, there is a class of
demand functions called <font color="#0000ff">constant-elasticity</font> <A href="#demand"><strong>demand functions</strong></A>
where the elasticity remains the same at every price-quantity
pair satisfying this demand function.</p>

<h3><a name="forecasting">Forecasting</a> time series</h3>
<p>In case there is a good reason to believe that an economic variable (such as 
quantity demanded at a given price) follows a single trend,
<font color="#FF0000">forecasting</font> by extrapolating a time series tend to 
be an easy method for predicting the economic variable. A time series is a list 
of realizations at each given point in time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, or 
yearly observations). </p>
<p>The <font color="#FF0000">naive one-step forecasting</font> is asigning the 
latest realization as the best predictor for next period's observation. A
<font color="#FF0000">moving-average forecast</font> would be the average of 
some past observations. For example, a 4-period moving average forecast would 
involve averaging the past 4 observations as the predictor of next-period 
realization.</p>
<p>The problem with the naive forecast is that it is subjected to large errors 
caused by seasonal fluctuations or some unforseen events. Therefore, a common 
forecasting technique involves <font color="#FF0000">smoothing</font> in order 
to mitigate some of the more volatile short-term fluctuations. There are various 
methods of smoothing. The method used here is called exponential smoothing which 
turns out to be a weighted average of the naive and the moving-average 
forecasts.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">Forecasting demand by extrapolating a time series differs 
significantly from estimating a <a href="#demand">demand function</a> utilizing
<a href="#regression">regression</a> techniques. A time series extrapolation 
assumes that the demand follows a certain trend over time. However, a regression 
technique attemts to estimate the precise relationship between quantity and 
prices. Of course, more sophisticated regression techniques would involve 
regressing quantity demanded on past prices and quantities.</p>

<h3><a name="homogeneous">Homogeneous products</a></h3>
<p>A strict definition of <font color="#ff0000"> homogeneous products</font> 
would mean brands in which consumers do not bother to investigate
if and whether there differences between the competing
products or a services. In particular, consumers do not inquire about the names of
the producers in these markets.&nbsp; In such markets, there are no leading brand
names, and very little advertising (if any) is observed.</p>
<p>Price competition among firms/stores selling homogenous products or services
is the most intense, and often leads to <font color="#0000ff">marginal cost</font>
pricing since consumers always pick the cheapest brand, and do not remain loyal
to any particular seller.&nbsp; This leads firms to invest in heavy advertising
in order to turn homogeneous products into <A href="#differentiated"><strong>differentiated products</strong></A>
 (differentiated brands).&nbsp; For example, gas station engage in heavy
advertising in order to persuade customers that their gasoline is special and
differs from the competing brands (despite the fact that there are no
differences between the different brands (for the same octane level).</p>

<h3><a name="merger">Merger guidelines</a></h3>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Mergers</font> are classified into three types: <font color="#FF0000">Horizontal
merger</font> when firms in the same industry, producing identical or similar products and selling in the same geographical market, merge.&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Vertical merger</font> when a firm producing an intermediate good
(or a factor of production) merges with a firm producing the final good that uses this<br>
intermediate good.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Conglomerate merger</font> occurs when firms producing less related products merge under the same<br>
ownership.<br>
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Merger guidelines</font> constitute suggestions to
regulating authorities (FTC, DOJ, in the U.S.) when to consider challenging a
horizontal merger.&nbsp; Among other consideration, the regulator computes pre-
and post-merger <a href="#concentration">concentration indexes</a> for this
industry. </p>
<h5><A href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</A></h5>
<hr>


<h3><a name="network">Network Services and Products</a></h3>
<p> <font color="#ff0000">Network goods</font> refer to services and products in which consumers' willingness to pay increases 
the total number of all consumers subscribing to the same service (or buying the same product).
</p>

<p>
Telecommunication services are regarded as network services since consumers' utility is enhanced with an increase in the number
of other consumers with who each subscriber can communication.  For example, the demand for fax machines and the demand for electronic mail services.
</p>

<p>
The <font color="#0000ff">inverse</font> <A href="#demand"><strong>demand</strong></A> 
function for network services and goods may be increasing at early subscription
stages (low aggregate consumption levels) reflecting the fact that consumers are
willing to pay a higher (subscription) prices for more popular services .</p>

<h3><a name="overbooking">Overbooking</a></h3>
<p>The practice of <font color="#FF0000">overbooking</font> means selling tickets (making reservations) beyond the 
<a href="#capacity">capacity</a> of the service provider.
This practice reduces expected underutilization of capacity in the presence of positive probability of 
<font color="#FF0000">no-shows</font>. Overbooking is a strategy related to a 
more general practice called <font color="#FF0000">advance booking of orders</font> 
(ABO).&nbsp; Advance booking is essential in industries where demand is expected 
to exceeds the capacity of service provider. Overbooking is also related to 
whether the service provider (producer, in general) makes <a href="#refund">
refundable or non-refundable</a> bookings of orders (e.g., selling refundable or 
non-refundable tickets).</p>
<p>Those consumers who make reservations and show up for the service are called <font color="#FF0000">survivals</font>. If the number of survivals (the number of those who show up for the service) 
exceeds capacity, the excess is <font color="#FF0000">oversales (oversold 
customers)</font>. If the number of survivals is less than capacity, the 
difference between capacity and survivals is <font color="#FF0000">spoilage</font> 
(or, underutilized capacity). 
</p>
<p>The service provider's decision problem is to maximize expected payoff which 
includes the cost of both spoilage and oversales. Oversales result in a wide 
variety of costs to the service provider, which include goodwill cost (angry 
customers), penalty costs, and having to refund the ticket price to consumes who 
are <font color="#FF0000">denied service</font> (bumped consumers). 
</p>
<p>Finally, overbooking is heavily practiced in the airline industry. Some 
flights are overbooked with more than 30% of seating capacity. The FAA issues 
direct guidelines which limits overbooking, and direct the airline how a 
passenger who is denied service must be compensated.</p>

<h3><a name="peak">Peak-load pricing</a></h3><p>Peak-load pricing applies to 
markets&nbsp;for&nbsp;products and services of the following 
characteristics:</p>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Fluctuations in demand&nbsp;according to time periods 
  (called&nbsp;seasons).</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>The product/service is non-storable meaning that it cannot be purchased 
  in one season and used in another season.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Production of this product or a service requires a large investment in 
  capacity.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P><FONT color=red>Examples:</FONT> (a) Production of electricity requires a 
large investment in capacity in the form of generators.&nbsp; Electricity is 
non-storable, and demand fluctuates between day and night, and weekdays and 
weekends.&nbsp; (b) Air travel requires airline companies to invest in aircraft 
capacity.&nbsp; Travel is non-storable and demand varies between winter and 
summer.</P>
<P><FONT color=red>Time lengths:</FONT>&nbsp; Time is divided into 
periods.&nbsp; Periods are devided into seasons.&nbsp; For example, we can 
identify periods with years, where each year is divided into two seasons called 
winter and summer.</P>
<P><FONT color=red>Cost of production:</FONT> There are three types of 
costs:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Marginal cost of operation, denoted by <EM>oc</EM>  
  (operating cost).&nbsp; This is the cost of producing/providing one 
  additional unit.&nbsp; For example, producing one additional kilowatt/hour&nbsp;of 
  electricity, cost of ticketing and boarding one additional passenger on a 
  plane.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Marginal cost of capacity, denoted by <EM>cc</EM> (capacity cost).&nbsp; 
  </DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Fixed (or sunk) cost, denoted by <EM>F</EM>.&nbsp; This cost is 
  independent of the level of production.</DIV></LI></OL>
<P><FONT color=red>Seasons, time periods,&nbsp;and the allocation of production 
costs:</FONT>&nbsp; Suppose that there are only two seasons (e.g., 
winter/summer, or day/night).&nbsp; Then, we assume that additional unit of 
capacity (cost denoted by <EM>cc</EM>) is usable in both seasons.&nbsp; That is, 
capacity is purchased only once and lasts for two seasons.&nbsp; In contrast, 
operating cost (denoted by <EM>oc</EM>) must be paid each season.</P>
<P>Suppose now that the two seasons are repeated <EM>n</EM> periods (e.g., 
winter and summer are repeated <EM>n</EM> years).&nbsp; Then, assuming that 
capacity lasts for the entire n periods, the capacity cost becomes 
<EM>cc</EM>/<EM>n</EM> per period (constisting of two seasons).</P>

<h3><a name="refund">Refundable and non-refundable bookings</a></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Advance booking of orders</font> has two advantages: 
(a) Consumers (buyers) can ensure that the service provider (or seller, in 
general) will provide the service when it is scheduled to be delivered. (b) For 
sellers, advance booking is used to estimate the actual demand at the time of 
delivery. 
</p>
<p>One problem with advance booking is that customers may not show up at the 
delivery time. If the orders are <font color="#FF0000">fully-refundable</font> 
(e.g., refundable tickets),&nbsp; then the cost of <font color="#FF0000">
no-shows</font> (stemming from under-utilized <a href="#capacity">capacity</a>), 
are borne by the service provider (seller, in general). In contrast, if the 
bookings are non-refundable (e.g., non-refundable tickets), the costs of 
no-shows are borne by consumers only. This implies that service providers should 
price refundable tickets higher than non-refundable tickets. If only 
fully-refundable tickets are sold, the seller may exercise an
<a href="#overbooking">overbooking</a> strategy (if it is legal).</p>
<p>The service provider has three options:<br>
(a) Selling non-refundable tickets.<br>
(b) Selling fully-refundable tickets.<br>
(c) Selling, both, refundable and non-refundable tickets. Under this booking 
strategy, consumers who are likely to show up purchase the discounted 
non-refundable tickets, whereas consumers who are less likely to show up (less 
reliable consumers) purchase fully-refundable tickets. 
</p>
<p>Finally, refundability options are heavily practiced in the airline industry. 
Full-fare, Business, and First-class tickets tend to be fully-refundable. In 
contrast, several types of discounted tickets are non-refundable. </p>

<h3><a name="regression">Regression (Statistical estimation)</a></h3>
<p> <font color="#ff0000">Regression</font>  is a statistic technique of fitting
a functional relationship among economic variables by cataloging the observed
variables, and then utilizing well-known formulas to extract the exogenous
parameters of the functional relationship.
</p>

<p>In microeconomics, regressions are heavily used to estimate <A href="#demand"><strong>demand</strong></A> 
functions by cataloging observed prices and quantity demanded, thereby obtaining
the parameters characterizing the functional relationship</p>
<p>The most common used method is known as ordinary least squares (a method
which minimizes the sum of squared errors).&nbsp; Simple linear regressions
refer to fitting of linear functions (such as <font color="#0000ff">linear
demand functions</font>).&nbsp; Exponential demand functions are estimated by
cataloging the natural logs of the observed variables and utilizing linear
regressions (double-logarithmic estimation).&nbsp; You are welcome to use the
regression pages given on this site.&nbsp; In fact, all the demand functions
used on this site can be estimated on the sites' regression pages.&nbsp;
However, you should also be aware of the fact that almost all spreadsheet
programs provide regression analyses.&nbsp; Thus, if you have data sets
containing a large number of observations you may be better off saving this data
as a spreadsheet file and run the regressions utilizing the same software.&nbsp;
The popular spreadsheet programs can also draw the regression lines for you
together with the observation you catalog.</p>
<p>If your demand observations consist of a time series that follows a single 
trend (say, because there are no significant changes in the market price), you 
may want to consider utilizing a <a href="#forecasting">forecasting</a> 
technique extrapolating a time series.</p>

<h3><a name="switch">Switching costs</a></h3>
<P><font color="#ff0000">Switching costs</font> refers to the total cost associated with using a brand
different from the brand which was initially purchased.&nbsp; Switching costs
could be explicit (such as the time it takes to learn how to operate a new
brand), or implicit (such as loss of long-term relationship with service
providers when choosing a different service, or emotional stress in getting used
to rules of the new service provider). </P>
<P>Examples for switching costs in various industries are: Loss of
frequent-flyer mileage when switching airline carriers.&nbsp; Learning how to
use a computer operating on a different operating system.&nbsp; Getting salaries
and paid bills via a newly-opened account with a competing bank. </P>
<p>Just like <A href="#differentiated"><strong>differentiated products</strong></A>
, switching costs are known to weaken price
competition since consumers are unlikely to switch brand unless the competing
bank is sufficiently (price-wise) discounted to compensate the consumer for
bearing the switching costs. To solve for market equilibrium prices under 
switching costs one has to utilize the <b><a href="#upe">undercut-proof 
equilibrium</a></b> concept.</p>

<h3><a name="tying">Tying</a></h3>
<p>            <font color="#ff0000">            Tying</font> refers to the sale of a package containing different goods
for a single price (rather than pricing each good separately).&nbsp; Tying could
be made explicitly (e.g., assorted fruits, assorted tools, hardware tied with
software, etc.), or it can be made implicitly (e.g., buy one package and get a
"free" T-shirt).&nbsp; Tying differs from <A href="#bundling"><strong>bundling</strong></A>
 which refers to a
package containing several units of the same good.</p>

<h3><a name="upe">Undercut-proof equilibrium prices</a></h3>
<p>            <font color="#ff0000">            Undercut-proof prices </font>
are equilibrium prices in which no seller would find it profitable to lower his 
price below any rival's price and subsidize the rivals consumer switching costs 
in order to grab the rival's customers to switch brands. Undercut-proof 
equilibrium is used to solve for equilibrium prices when consumers bear
<a href="#switch">switching costs</a> of switching from the brand they purchased 
before to a different brand.</p>
